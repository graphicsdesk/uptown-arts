* Much of Pape’s art investigates the interplay of science, mathematics, and nature. This particular piece, “CelNav,” features a continuous knot interrupted by what Pape calls “impossible shapes,” which appear in much of her work. She notices that upon viewing these impossible shapes, the mind automatically tries to make sense of them.
* She hopes that her pieces will perhaps disarm that impulse to cohere the impossible to human principles of logic. “Can we sit in that space of uncertainty or what happens when you sit in it, and you know, if you say, wait that conclusion's wrong or, or are you even able to question your conclusions?”

* This piece by Mercedes, “Millennial Chombo,” features the patron saint of Masaya, Nicaragua, reimagined. Instead of his usual cross, he carries a makeshift rifle and a smartphone, two tools that students in the violent power struggle in Masaya (and Nicaragua writ large) are using to defend themselves against the despotic government.
* With this piece Mercedes says he hopes to revive the ancient meaning of the saint and imbue  him with youth to show what he means for millenials. He describes that the church has been supporting students who are at the center of anti-government protests in Masaya. “A lot of what I do is commentary, not necessarily, I wouldn't even call it political. It's more like a social awareness, you know, I'm a lot more about awareness and trying to expand consciousness.”

* This piece, “Sun Este” speaks to the collision of Abstract Expressionism and Primitivism that manifests in Mercedes’s work. Abstract Expressionism, including artists like Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko, is marked by a suspension is recognizable figures in favor of gesture, or the energy involved in the process of making the art. Primitivism, including artists like Paul Gauguin, and Mercedes’s favorite, Jean-Michel Basquiat, is marked by bright colors and tribal resonances.

* Maggie Hernández’s home studio is as bright and lively as the art that fills it. Natural light, french doors, and buttercream paint on the walls give the space a carefree zest.

* This piece of Hernández’s, called “Whipped,” has a loose playfulness that reflects her process, which prefers the act of creating over the result of any one piece.
* “When you work intuitively like that and you're just moving, moving and you're not really thinking about it, sometimes they're bad to look at. But as an experience, for me, it's like cathartic because I'm just in it. Going, moving with a brush and not thinking about anything. It's almost like people who say that they spend hours in meditation clearing their mind, that's what I feel happens to me.”
