Written by Keri Kelly\n* Graphics by Jason Kao and Raeedah Wahid\n* Illustration by Brenda Huang\n[]\n\n[contentBefore]\n\n* In Upper Manhattan, artists and art lovers are neighbors. If you were living in an uptown neighborhood like Harlem, Washington Heights, or Inwood before 2003, though, you may have been completely unaware. Franck de las Mercedes, an abstract artist living and working in Washington Heights, often feels the anonymity of Manhattan. \u201cNew York can be like a small city, but it can be like a big city at times. And you know, sometimes it\u2019s just like a whole universe.\u201d Mercedes was shocked to find out, through his participation in the Uptown Arts Stroll, that two fellow artists lived just around the corner from him.\n\n* In 2003, the birth of the Uptown Arts Stroll changed this dynamic of disjunction. Created as a daylong event by Mike Fitelson and Rosa Naparstek, Arts Stroll, which has been sponsored by Columbia since at least 2009, was initially an effort to scout and make available much needed dedicated gallery and performance spaces. Five years after its inception, the Northern Manhattan Arts Alliance took over the festival and nurtured its enormous potential. It has since ballooned into a month-long event, taking place in June, featuring <a href="http://www.artstroll.com/open-studios/">open studios</a>, <a href="https://www.artstroll.com/events/">art exhibitions, concerts, literary events, and performances</a>. This year\u2019s Arts Stroll begins with the <a href="https://www.artstroll.com/event/uptown-arts-stroll-opening-reception/">opening reception</a> on May 28 and runs through the end of June. As of now, the Stroll features dance, comedy, theater performances, concerts, exhibitions of painting, sculpture, photography, staged readings of plays, film screenings, open mics, workshops, artist talks, and more. \n\n* Through these events, the Stroll has unified and fortified the already-vibrant artist community in uptown Manhattan by spinning a vast web of connections between artists, art lovers, and local businesses, as well as by creating opportunities for artists to display their work in public spaces, to develop technical skills, and to receive intimate feedback. Just as the Stroll energizes the art world in uptown Manhattan, uptown Manhattan community members are what fuel the Stroll. Joanna Castro, executive director of NoMAA says that a diversity of disciplines, mediums, and perspectives has caused the festival to grow and evolve. \u201cPeople keep pushing the limits in terms of really being avant garde, and thinking outside the box, so you can see really great work without leaving the community.\u201d\n\n* IMAGE: https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-spectator.s3.amazonaws.com/public/I2USE3DM6BA6NKM3IW4PM63IRQ.jpg, Joanna Castro, executive director of NoMAA, works at her desk.\n\n* <b>A Chance for Visibility</b>\n\n* The conceptual kernel Fitelson and Naparstek agreed upon was that new gallery space needed to be forged uptown and that artists needed to be connected with those spaces in order to exhibit their work. It was a twofold project of increasing visibility: Artists would get exposure for their work, and art would become readily available to people in the community. Fundamentally,\u201d Naparstek remarks, \u201cThe Uptown Arts Stroll has allowed artists to have places to exhibit and to be seen. And that\u2019s invaluable.\u201d\n\n* At the time, Fitelson was working as an associate publisher for a bilingual newspaper called the Manhattan Times, which, according to him, sought to \u201cunite the community\u201d by transcending the language barrier. Fitelson remembers brainstorming ideas to further that goal of unity and thought of art as a possible method, as he calls it, \u201ca universal language.\u201d\n\n* He reached out to Naparstek, founder and director of <a href="http://artistsunite-ny.org/">Artists Unite</a>, a nonprofit organization focused on facilitating artist cooperation and exhibition, who had plenty of her own ideas about expanding gallery space. In fact, through her efforts with Artists Unite, she was in the midst of what she describes as a \u201c10-year struggle with the MTA\u201d to allow artists to display their work in <a href="https://artistsunite.ning.com/profiles/blogs/celebration-artists-unite-mta-subway-elevator-poster-project">subway elevators</a>, a struggle which Artists Unite eventually won.\n\n* The project of visibility has surpassed intra-uptown promotion. Beyond individual artists gaining exposure in their own communities, the Stroll has brought attention to uptown Manhattan as a whole. Fitelson says he thinks the Stroll has been so momentous in recent years in part due to the pride of sharing uptown culture with people who may not normally experience it. It\u2019s a chance, he explains, \u201cto be able to invite friends and family up here for a change, to come and see what we do, and how we do it, to be proud of the community spirit that infuses the Stroll.\u201d\n\n* The Arts Stroll is open to anyone within the large chunk of uptown Manhattan (specified on NoMAA\u2019s website as \u201cUpper Manhattan, West 135th to 155th Street from Edgecombe Avenue west, and West 155th to 220th Street river-to-river\u201d) to participate, by simply registering online. \n\n* The festival has been sponsored from its start by Columbia\u2019s Office of Government and Community Affairs, Castro tells me. She calls them a \u201clong-standing community partner.\u201d\n\n* I ask Fitelson about how he sees uptown fitting into the landscape of other New York City artistic hubs like the East Village and Bushwick, and whether he\u2019s noticed an influx of new creatives to the area in recent year. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s been a critical mass of artists up here for a very long time,\u201d he replies. \u201cThat was one of the reasons why we started this and it was so easy to do is because there was so much talent.\u201d\n\n* <b>A Web of Community</b>\n\n* IMAGE: https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-spectator.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HIF3DK6GPJFWJHQH2VL5SJCQKA.jpg, Franck de las Mercedes poses for a portrait in his studio with artwork in hand.\n\n* Mercedes has started his life over from scratch, twice: Once in 1985 as an 11-year-old child fleeing his war-torn hometown of Masaya, Nicaragua for Washington Heights, and again in 2014 as a 40-year-old man, returning to Washington Heights after a fire in his New Jersey home vaporized all his possessions and life\u2019s work in just seven minutes. \n\n* As he tells me all this, Mercedes moves around his spacious, painting-filled apartment, unencumbered and spry. He emphatically describes his work, careening toward it, using sharp hand gestures. He remembers that upon resettling in Washington Heights, the community took him in and that the Arts Stroll was a big part of that community-building. \n\n* Mercedes is a repeat participant in open studios for the Arts Stroll, which is a popular component of the festival in which artists open their creative spaces for an afternoon and invite the community visit at their leisure, offering a somewhat \u2018behind-the-scenes\u2019 look at their work and process. In the case of Mercedes\u2019 open studio, this means also opening his home. He reports that people will enter his studio and say \u201c\u2018Oh my god, we\u2019ve got an artist here!\u2019\u201d\n\n* Mercedes\u2019 distinct artistic style is a combination of many influences. He considers himself to be in the school of abstract expressionism; seeing Jackson Pollock\u2019s \u201cAutumn Rhythm\u201d spurred his epiphany that perhaps he was more than just a serial doodler. His bright color scheme has roots in the vibrant, lush nature of his homeland in Masaya and the artistic movement of primitivism that is popular there. He is also creatively stimulated by his immediate environment in Washington Heights, namely the street art and graffiti that decorates countless surfaces. \u201cI\u2019m always looking around this neighborhood, you know, for like someone to depict or you know, use in some way for a painting or artwork.\u201d\n\n* IMAGE: https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-spectator.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5FAQNSKK7NFFHCD5M74CMDTLEI.jpg, de las Mercedes assesses a frame.\n\n* Mercedes claims that the Arts Stroll is a great way to \u201cbuild a bridge\u201d between artists and the community. \u201cIt\u2019s reciprocal. The viewer and the artist are enriched by the experience.\u201d\n\n* Between the years of 2006 and 2016, Mercedes embarked on something he calls the Peace Boxes Project. He collected cardboard shipping boxes, made abstract paintings on them, placed a label on them reading FRAGILE HANDLE WITH CARE, CONTAINS PEACE (or hope, love, etc.), and shipped them out to anybody who wanted one.\n\n* This endeavor, perhaps Mercedes\u2019s most iconic project, came from a suggestion made by a local postal worker. Mercedes had formed a somewhat subconscious habit of cleaning his brushes on, and even painting the boxes he used to ship his artwork to buyers. \u201cThey would see me walk in with these painted boxes, and one day the postal worker said to me, \u2018Ever occur to you that your boxes are works of art too?\u2019\u201d \n\n* Mercedes says he knew he \u201chad something\u201d with the painted boxes, and that something eventually evolved into a massive effort in which he sent over 18,000 boxes to 70 countries worldwide. Even though he is largely finished with the peace boxes, they are still being created by schools, mental health counselors, and art therapists. Reflecting on the whole experience, Mercedes says, \u201cIt was that interaction with people\u2014which is again, back to why it\u2019s important to have open studios and things like this\u2014that interaction with people\u2014 that makes you a better artist.\u201d\n\n* Mercedes says that he\u2019s flourished since coming back to Washington Heights in 2014: He feels more accomplished as an artist, and he\u2019s realized that art sometimes starts at home. \u201cYou realize that when you\u2019re an artist, sometimes you\u2019re looking out or far ahead or far away from where you are, and then you discover that right where you are is a great opportunity not only to make art, but to network, to grow, and to even build a following, if you will, with the people that are around you.\u201d\n\n* IMAGE: https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-spectator.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YGIRTTLNUND4ZBGU3ESRW3YBRQ.jpg, Maggie Hern\xe1ndez poses for a portrait in her studio.\n\n* Just a few blocks away from Mercedes lives Maggie Hern\xe1ndez, an abstract painter and long-time Arts Stroll open studios participant. For her, art is about joy, catharsis, resiliency, and most importantly, freedom. The language of abstraction allows her to express the outspokenness and independence she feels was stifled in her childhood as a sixties baby in the household of her fairly traditional mother. Her paintings are a dazzling landscape of bright colors that relentlessly engage the viewer. Looking at the heaps of decorated canvas in her apartment studio, I can easily visualize how she describes her painting process\u2014she works quick, with music playing, moving freely. \u201cI just literally dip wherever my hand goes,\u201d she laughs. \n\n* Hern\xe1ndez used to work at Citibank, and her co-workers knew she was an artist, \u201cso it was a constant flow of people buying.\u201d She would sell her paintings for top dollar: It was a \u201cgoldmine.\u201d\n\n* She found she had to tweak her model, however, once she started participating in open studios. \u201cI\u2019d have the Art Stroll open studio, and then people in the neighborhood would come, and they\u2019d ask me how much, you know, for a piece. And I would tell them like $1,500, $3,000, and nobody could buy it. I was like, that is just so wrong.\u201d So Hern\xe1ndez scaled down. She switched to smaller and cheaper canvases, and started buying them in bulk when the materials are on sale, so that she could in turn sell the paintings for less. \n\n* After a piece has been sitting around unsold in her apartment for a few years, she puts it in the lobby of her building for people to take for free. \u201cPeople in this building tell me \u2018My house is full of your art!\u2019\u201d\n\n* Hernandez is not interested in galleries. \u201cI\u2019d rather make the art for the people in my neighborhood, and that\u2019s what I do.\u201d\n\n* She says she\u2019s found that \u201cthere\u2019s a certain type of person that\u2019s into art and it\u2019s usually not just like local people.\u201d She continues, \u201cI find that local people are just kind of like busy, just working, getting food on the table, like the normal demands of living. Right? And looking at art, or going to museums, leaving the neighborhood for some is just not even something that is available.\u201d \n\n* \u201cI grew up with people who never left the Heights,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat?!\u201d \n\n* IMAGE: https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-spectator.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5ZPI5FKGM5CLNE3SFELW7UUYSU.jpg, Hern\xe1ndez hangs a painting on her wall.\n\n* She wants anybody to be able to experience the same joy she feels when creating paintings. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of value in art. \u2026 And why should only the affluent be able to enjoy that?\u201d\n\n* Hern\xe1ndez has found her calling in abstract art. \u201cI don\u2019t ever see myself going back to do anything that resembles anything at all.\u201d She goes on to mention the one exception: the backdrops she paints for her old dance teacher, who lives in the neighborhood, stages performance shows. \u201cI\u2019ll paint and draw ballerinas for her, you know, whatever\u2019s needed. But other than that, never.\u201d\n \n* <b>A Laboratory for Artistic Experimentation</b>\n\n* Sky Pape is an abstract painter who has been living in Inwood for 18 years. For much of her <a href="http://www.skypape.com/">artistic career</a>, until 1999, she also held a position as a schizophrenia researcher at NewYork-Presbyterian (then Columbia Presbyterian). The interplay of science, math, nature, and human perception is central to her work, and she constantly experiments. \u201cI often work with sort of traditional materials used in untraditional ways. \u2026 I\u2019ll use brushes that I make myself or I use palm fronds as a drawing tool.\u201d\n\n* An open studios participant almost every year since it was introduced to the Stroll in 2004, Pape has come to recognize the value of viewing art in the space of its creation. As opposed to galleries which, in her experience, display art with a focused and cohesive theme for marketing purposes, the studio is more relaxed and allows for more variety. This setup is more conducive to the way she works as an artist. She\u2019s constantly digressing from her primary projects to explore, creating what she calls \u201cone-offs.\u201d \n\n* Open studios is a chance to see some of Pape\u2019s \u201ctangential explorations,\u201d as she calls them. \u201cI\u2019ll pull all sorts of weird stuff out of my drawers and toss it up on the wall,\u201d she says. Pape remarks that seeing these \u201cone-offs,\u201d works in progress, or nontraditional materials gives viewers \u201ca broader appreciation of the creative process.\u201d \n\n* James Bosley has been participating in the Arts Stroll since 2010 as artistic director of UP Theater Company, an organization dedicated to producing new plays by contemporary playwrights, which, according to Bosley, often \u201cpush the envelope.\u201d The company hosts a reading every year during Arts Stroll, and this coming year it is Bosley\u2019s own play, \u201c<a href="https://www.artstroll.com/es/event/reading-of-the-greater-compassion-a-new-play-by-up-theater-companys-artistic-director-james-bosley/">The Greater Compassion</a>,\u201d about a family of urban Buddhists.\n\n* Bosley says that because of the extensive labor of putting on a full production, which the company does every spring, the Arts Stroll reading is a great place to test out new material in a less intensive way.\n\n* He also mentions that because much of the audience are uptown folks\u2014\u201cthey could be neighbors and friends\u201d\u2014it is a more comfortable experience. \u201cYou feel safe, you know, in a situation \u2026 where you\u2019re being encouraged, and there\u2019s a certain amount of helpfulness in the audience, rather than very harsh criticism.\u201d\n\n[artists]\n\nartist: Sky Pape\n\n[.artworks]\n\n\nimage: https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-spectator.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NMPX4BCKE5EDBCKNTJQ7CXPENE.jpg\n[.steps]\n* Much of Pape\u2019s art investigates the interplay of science, mathematics, and nature. This particular piece, \u201cCelNav,\u201d features a continuous knot interrupted by what Pape calls \u201cimpossible shapes,\u201d which appear in much of her work. She notices that upon viewing these impossible shapes, the mind automatically tries to make sense of them.\n* She hopes that her pieces will perhaps disarm that impulse to cohere the impossible to human principles of logic. \u201cCan we sit in that space of uncertainty or what happens when you sit in it, and you know, if you say, wait that conclusion\'s wrong or, or are you even able to question your conclusions?\u201d\n[]\ncredit: "CelNav," water, Sumi ink, Flashe on paper, 51-3/4" h x 39-3/4" w (Courtesy Sky Pape & June Kelly Gallery, NY.

Instead of his usual cross, he carries a makeshift rifle and a smartphone, two tools that students in the violent power struggle in Masaya (and Nicaragua writ large) are using to defend themselves against the despotic government.\n* With this piece Mercedes says he hopes to revive the ancient meaning of the saint and imbue  him with youth to show what he means for millenials. He describes that the church has been supporting students who are at the center of anti-government protests in Masaya. \u201cA lot of what I do is commentary, not necessarily, I wouldn\'t even call it political. It\'s more like a social awareness, you know, I\'m a lot more about awareness and trying to expand consciousness.\u201d\n[]\ncredit: \u201cMillennial Chombo\u201d 2019, Acrylic on canvas 28" x 38" (Courtesy The FdlM Studio) \n\n\nimage: https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-spectator.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZG4T4MFYYJASHLTKYXESSL2CK4.jpg\n[.steps]\n* This piece, \u201cSun Este\u201d speaks to the collision of Abstract Expressionism and Primitivism that manifests in Mercedes\u2019s work. Abstract Expressionism, including artists like Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko, is marked by a suspension is recognizable figures in favor of gesture, or the energy involved in the process of making the art. Primitivism, including artists like Paul Gauguin, and Mercedes\u2019s favorite, Jean-Michel Basquiat, is marked by bright colors and tribal resonances. \n[]\ncredit: \u201cSun Este\u201d  2019, Acrylic on canvas 26" x 20" (Courtesy The FdlM Studio)\n\n[]\n\nartist: Maggie Hern\xe1ndez\n\n[.artworks]\n\n\nimage: https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-spectator.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6JWKAE3TORBYNDAJZUIVFPUZKA.jpg\n[.steps]\n* Maggie Hern\xe1ndez\u2019s home studio is as bright and lively as the art that fills it.

But as an experience, for me, it\'s like cathartic because I\'m just in it. Going, moving with a brush and not thinking about anything. It\'s almost like people who say that they spend hours in meditation clearing their mind, that\'s what I feel happens to me.\u201d\n[]\ncredit: Whipped, 2019, Acrylic on Canvas, 24x24\u201d Maggie Hernandez\n\n[]\n\n[contentAfter]\n\n* <b>A Gateway to NoMAA</b>\n\n* NoMAA is a gold mine of artistic support and programming for Upper Manhattan. Besides the Arts Stroll, it offer all kinds of events throughout the year, such as technical assistance like <a href="https://www.nomaanyc.org/2018/08/free-bilingual-grant-writing-clinic/">grant writing</a> and <a href="http://www.uptowncollective.com/2019/04/05/06-05-19-digging-deeper-social-media-for-artists-arts-professionals/">social media workshops</a>, themed exhibits like <a href="https://www.nomaanyc.org/2019/03/women-in-the-heights-creating-for-change/">Women in the Heights</a> and <a href="http://www.nomaanyc.org/2017/10/the-art-of-healing/">The Art of Healing</a>, and events purely for fun like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/northernmanhattanartsalliance/photos/gm.1857470130944631/10155847519634851/?type=3&theater">neighborhood Halloween parties</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/northernmanhattanartsalliance/photos/gm.2364272580265830/10156628542884851/?type=3&theater">free dance improvisation</a> classes in Inwood Park.\n\n* The Stroll has not only grown in duration, from a day to a month, but also in level of participation. Castro, who plans, organizes, and promotes the Arts Stroll along with much of NoMAA\u2019s other programming, recalls that when she served as program director of NoMAA in 2014, the guide listed 175 events. Last year it listed over 350.\n\n* Castro and her team of two people\u2014Michelle Orsi Gordon, executive coordinator, and Martin Collins, 2019 Uptown Arts Stroll coordinator\u2014are constantly looking to improve the Stroll. The three visit all the open studios and give feedback to the artists. They also send out a survey to every participant, seeking new ideas and improvement. \u201cOur mission is to visit as many events as possible\u2026\u201d Castro says, \u201cIt\'s a really great opportunity to connect and reconnect with folks.\u201d \n\n* In the future, Castro hopes to sustain the explosive growth of the Stroll, and encourage the artistic talent that exists uptown in surplus.\n\n* BREAK\n\n* Artists have lived in Upper Manhattan for a long time. The arts haven\u2019t suddenly \u201carrived\u201d in Uptown; rather, through grassroots efforts by a few diligent community members, the Uptown Arts Stroll has invigorated and connected the art world in uptown. \n\n* When I ask Naparstek about her initial ideas for the Arts Stroll 16 years ago, she says she thought about starting a bus tour to bring tourists and people from downtown to uptown Manhattan to see art. That idea morphed into something different, something with a focus on the people in its own backyard as the audience. \n\n* Pape acknowledges the art world\u2019s tendency to place emphasis on a \u201cspecific slice of artists,\u201d and says that \u201cthere\u2019s a whole community of underrepresented artists who have been here all along, who are just not in the spotlight.\u201d\n\n* As Upper Manhattan faces the <a href="https://www.nycedc.com/sites/default/files/filemanager/Projects/20180813_final_zoning_districts-01.jpg">shuffling around</a> that often accompanies rapid urban development, it could turn to the infrastructure of community created by the Stroll to sustain connection as their landscape changes. Art could serve as a way for the neighborhoods to see themselves, in the place where they live.\n\n* Naparstek says, \u201cThe maybe dream for us was to make our own community aware of the arts ambition that\u2019s right here.\u201d\n\n* <i>Enjoy leafing through our eleventh issue!</i><br/><a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/eye/issue/n/XXVI/10/">Previous Issue</a> | <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/eye/issue/n/XXVI/11/">More In This Issue</a>\n\n[]\n\n'),T=N.header,H=N.contentBefore,z=N.artists,C=N.contentAfter,j=h()({App:{margin:"5vh 0 !important"}})(function(e){var t=e.classes;return o.a.createElement("div",{className:t.App},o.a.createElement(I,{header:T}),H.map(function(e){return e.startsWith("IMAGE:")?o.a.createElement(S,{key:e,text:e}):o.a.createElement(A,{key:e,text:e})}),o.a.createElement(x,{artists:z}),C.map(function(e){return e.startsWith("IMAGE:")?o.a.createElement(S,{key:e,text:e}):"BREAK"===e?o.a.createElement(M,{key:e}):o.a.createElement(A,{key:e,text:e})}))});Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));r.a.render(o.a.createElement(j,null),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then(function(e){e.unregister()})}},[[110,1,2]]]);
